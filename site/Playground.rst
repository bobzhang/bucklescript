There are two Playgrounds, one for `vanilla
OCaml <https:////bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo>`__, the other
for `Facebook
Reason <https:////bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/reason-demo>`__

Note that the playgrounds are only for demos and might not be the
latest. You should always use the command line as your production tool.
