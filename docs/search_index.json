BasicsFAQ\nCompiler options\nHow to adapt your build system\nSemantic differences from other backends\nWhy JavaScript?JavaScript is not just the browser language, it's also\nthe only existing cross platform language. It is truly\neverywhere: users don't need to install binaries or use package managers to access software, just a link will work.Another important factor is that the JavaScript VM is quite fast and keeps getting faster. \nThe JavaScript platform is therefore increasingly capable of supporting large applications.Why BuckleScript?BuckleScript is mainly designed to solve the problems of large scale JavaScript programming:Lack of type-safety: OCaml offers an industrial-strength state-of-the-art type system and provides type inference (i.e. No verbose type annotation required), which proves invaluable in managing large projects.\nDead code: A large amount of web-development relies on inclusion of code dependencies by copying or referencing CDNs (the very thing that makes JavaScript highly accessible), but this also introduces a lot of dead code. This impacts performance adversely when the JavaScript VM has to interpret code that will never be invoked. BuckleScript provides powerful dead-code elimination at all levels. Function and module level elimination is facilitated by the sophistication of the type-system of OCaml, and at the global level BuckleScript generates code ready for dead-code elimination done by bundling tools such as the Google closure-compiler.\nLack of offline optimizations: JavaScript is a dynamic language, it takes a performance-hit for the VM to optimize code at runtime. While some JS engines circumvent the problem to some extent by caching, this is not available to all environments, and lack of a strong type system also limits the level of optimizations possible. Again, BuckleScript, using features of the OCaml type-system and compiler implementation is able to provide many optimizations during offline compilation, allowing the runtime code to be extremely fast.\nWhile a strong type-system helps in countering these problems, at the same time we hope to avoid some of the problems faced in using other offline transpilation systems:Slow compilation:\nOCaml bytecode compilation is known to be fast (one or two orders of magnitude faster\nthan other similar langauges: Scala\nor Haskell), BuckleScript shares the same\nproperty. See the speeds at work in the playground.\nUn-readable JS Code:\nIn compiling to JavaScript, many systems generate code, that while syntactically and semantically correct is\nnot human-readable and very difficult to debug. Our BuckleScript implementation and the multi-pass compilation\nstrategy of OCaml, allows us to avoid name-mangling, and produce JavaScript code that is human-readable and easier to debug and maintain.\nLoss of code-structure:\nMany systems generate JavaScript code that is essentially a big ball of mud. We try to keep the original structure of the code by mapping one OCaml module to one JS module.\nResources for Learning OCamlThe offical ocaml website has a comprehensive list of tutorials about the OCaml language, targeted at both developers new to functional programming and type-systems, and developers already familiar with these concepts."},"Playground.html":{"url":"Playground.html","title":"OCaml & Reason Playgrounds","keywords":"","body":"There are two Playgrounds, one for\nvanilla OCaml,\nthe other for\nFacebook ReasonNote that the playgrounds are only for demos and might not be the latest.\nYou should always use the command line as your production tool."},"Installation.html":{"url":"Installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"IntroductionTo use BuckleScript, you need both a specific version of the OCaml compiler (tweaked to make BuckleScript possible), and the BuckleScript software itself. The instructions below show how to install each of these using standard package managers as well as how to build from source for Unix/Linux systems. Build directions will be updated once Windows systems are supported.Default installation procedure (using package managers)1. OCaml compiler from opam (optional)When working with OCaml we recommend using opam package manager, available here. You will benefit from the existing OCaml ecosystem.Once you have opam installed, ask opam to switch to using our version of the compiler:opam update\nopam switch 4.02.3+buckle-1\neval `opam config env`\nThis step is optional. npm installation will build the compiler from source if not installed from opam.2. BuckleScript from npm (required)The standard npm package management tool can be used to install BuckleScript. If you don't already have npm installed, follow the directions listed here. Once npm is installed, run the following command:npm install --save bs-platform\nAdvanced installation procedure (from source)BuckleScript has very few dependencies and building from source can easily be done.1. OCaml compilerTo build OCaml compiler from source, download the modified OCaml compiler source here (version 4.02.3+buckle-1):For detailed build instructions, follow the directions in the repo. A simple build would look something like this:cd ocaml\n./configure -prefix `pwd` # put your preferred directory\nmake world.opt\nmake install\nThe patched compiler is installed locally into your $(pwd)/bin\ndirectory. To start using it temporarily, check if ocamlc.opt and ocamlopt.opt exist in $(pwd)/bin, and temporarily add the location to your $(PATH) (e.g. - PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH).2. Installing BuckleScriptThe following directions assume you already have the correct version of ocamlopt.opt in your $PATH, having followed the process described in the previous section.Download the source from the repository. Then run the following commands:cd ./jscomp\nmake world\nAt the end, you should have a binary called bsc under jscomp/bin directory,\nwhich you can add to your $PATH. You could also set an environment variable\npointing to the stdlib, e.g. BSC_LIB=/path/to/jscomp/stdlib for ease of use.Note that by default, bsc will generate commonjs modules, you can\noverride such behavior by picking your own module system:MODULE_FLAGS='-bs-module amdjs' make world\nMODULE_FLAGS='-bs-module commonjs' make world\nMODULE_FLAGS='-bs-module goog:buckle' make world\nAlso see Create a simple example with npm"},"Create-a-simple-example-with-NPM.html":{"url":"Create-a-simple-example-with-NPM.html","title":"Create a simple example with NPM","keywords":"","body":"Create a temporary directory called npm_testmkdir npm_test\ncd npm_test\necho \"{}\" > package.json\nFirst, install BuckleScript.\n(For more advanced settings, please read\nInstallation.)npm install bs-platform --save\nSecond, create a file called hello.ml,echo 'let _ = Js.log \"hello bucklescript!\"' > hello.ml\nThird, build and run`npm bin`/bsc -c hello.ml\nnode hello.js\n"},"NPM-Support.html":{"url":"NPM-Support.html","title":"NPM Support","keywords":"","body":"BuckleScript extends the OCaml compiler options with several flags to\nprovide better experience for NPM users.To deploy your OCaml library as a npm packageIn general, you are expected to deploy two kinds of artifacts, the\ngenerated JS files and meta data which your OCaml dependencies rely\non.Since CommonJS has no namespaces, to allow JS files live in different\ndirectories, we have a flagbsc -bs-package-name $npm_package_name -bs-package-output path/to/your/js/dir -c a.ml\nBy passing this flag, bsc will store your package_name and\nrelative path to package.json in .cmj files.

This is particularly important when porting an existing application to JavaScript.Custom data typeIn OCaml, the C FFI allows the user to  define a custom data type and customize caml_compare, caml_hash behavior, etc.   This is not available in our backend (since we have no C FFI).Physical (in)equalityIn general, you should only use physical equality as an optimization technique, but not rely on its correctness, since it is tightly coupled with the runtime.String char rangeCurrently, BuckleScript assumes that the char range is 0-255. The user should be careful when they pass a JavaScript string to OCaml side. Note that we are working on a solution for this problem.Weak mapOCaml's weak map is not available in BuckleScript. The weak pointer is replaced by a strict pointer.IntegersOCaml has int, int32, nativeint and int64 types. Both int32 and int64 have the exact same semantic.int\nint in BuckleScript is the same as int32 where it's platform dependent.\nnativeint\nTreated as JavaScript float, except for division.

While those principles might change in the future, there are enforced today and can explain certain technical limitations BuckleScript has.Lambda RepresentationAs pictured in the diagram above, BuckleScript is primarily based on the Lambda representation of the OCaml compiler. While this representation is quite rich, some information is lost from the upstream representation. The patch to the OCaml compiler tries to enrich this representation in a non-intrusive way (see next section).Minimal Patch to the OCaml compilerBuckleScript requires patches to the OCaml compiler. One of the main reasons is to enrich the Lambda representation so that the generated code is as nice as possible. A design goal is to keep those patches minimal and useful for the OCaml compiler in general so that they can later be integrated.A common question is to wonder why BuckleScript transpiles an OCaml record value to a JavaScript array while a more intuitive representation would be a JavaScript object. This technical decision is a direct consequence of the above 2 design principles: the Lambda layer assumes in a lot of places that a record value is an array and such modification would be too large of a change to OCaml compiler.SoundnessBuckleScript preserves the soundness of the OCaml language. Assuming the FFI is correctly implemented, the type safety is preserved.Minimal new symbol creationIn order to make the JavaScript generated code as close as possible to the original OCaml core we thrive to introduce as few new symbols as possible."},"JS-call-OCaml.html":{"url":"JS-call-OCaml.html","title":"JS calling OCaml","keywords":"","body":"JS Calling OCamlSince BuckleScript guarantees that all OCaml functions are exported as is, no extra work is required to expose OCaml function to JavaScript.Some things need be taken care of:external exports are not exported as js functions, if you really\n want to export those external functions, please write val instead.\noperators are escaped, since Javascript does not support user\n defined operators.

These BuckleScript extensions\nfacilitate the integration of native JavaScript code and\nimprove the generated code.Like TypeScript, when building typesafe bindings from JS to OCaml, the user has to write type declarations.\nIn OCaml, unlike TypeScript, user does not need to create a separate .d.ts file, \nsince the type declaration also written in OCaml.The FFI is divided into several components:Binding to JS first-order functions\n\nBinding to JS high-order functions\n\nBinding to JS object literals\n\nBinding to JS classes\n\nExtensions to the language for debugger, regex and embedding raw JS code\n\nFFI to first-order JS functionsThis part is similar to traditional FFI, \nwith syntax as described below:external value-name :  typexpr =  external-declaration  attributes\nexternal-declaration :=     string-literal  \nUsers need to declare types for foreign functions (JS functions here) and \nprovide customized attributes.Attributesbs.valExampleexternal imul : int -> int -> int = \"Math.imul\" [@@bs.val]\nNote that if you want to make a single FFI for both C functions and JavaScript functions, you can \ngive the JavaScript foreign function a different name:external imul : int -> int -> int = \"c_imul\" [@@bs.val \"Math.imul\"]\nbs.new\n\nThis attribute is used to create a JavaScript object.\nExample:external create_date : unit -> t = \"Date\" [@@bs.new]\nlet date = create_date ()\nwill be compiled asvar date = new Date();\nbs.val\n\nThis attribute is used to bind to a JavaScript value type dom \n    (* Abstract type for the DOM *)\n\n external dom : dom = \"document\" [@@bs.val]\nbs.send\n\nThis attribute helps the user send a message to a JS objecttype id \n  (** Abstract type for id object *)\nexternal get_by_id : dom -> string -> id = \"getElementById\" [@@bs.send]\nThe object is always the first argument and actual arguments follow.getElementById dom \"xx\"\nwill be compiled asdom.getElementById(\"xx\")\nbs.get, bs.set\nThis attribute helps get and set the property of a JavaScript object.\n\ntype textarea\nexternal set_name : textarea -> string -> unit = \"name\" [@@bs.set]\nexternal get_name : textarea -> string = \"name\" [@@bs.get]\nbs.set_index bs.get_index\n\nThis attribute allows dynamic access to a JavaScript propertymodule Int32Array = struct\n  type t\n  external create : int -> t = \"Int32Array\" [@@bs.new]\n  external get : t -> int -> int = \"\" [@@bs.get_index]\n  external set : t -> int -> int -> unit = \"\" [@@bs.set_index]\nend\n\nbs.moduleQualify the JavaScript value by a module name external add : int -> int -> int = \"add\" [@@bs.val] [@@bs.module \"x\"]\n let f = add 3 4\nwill be compiled as var X = require(\"x\")\n var f = X.add(3,4)\n external add : int -> int -> int = \"add\" [@@bs.val] [@@bs.module \"x\" \"U\"]\n let f = add 3 4\nWill be compiled as var U = require(\"x\")\n var f = U.add(3,4)\n\nFFI to high-order JS functionsHigh order functions are functions where the callback can be another function. For example, suppose\nJS has a map function as below:function map (a, b, f){\n  var i = Math.min(a.length, b.length);\n  var c = new Array(i);\n  for(var j = 0; j \nA naive external type declaration would be as below:external map : 'a array -> 'b array -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c array = \"map\" [@@bs.val]\nUnfortunately, this is not completely correct. The issue is by \nreading the type 'a -> 'b -> 'c, it can be in several cases:let f x y = x + y\nlet g x  = let z  = x + 1 in fun y -> x + z \nIn OCaml, they all have the same type; however, \nf and g may be compiled into functions with\ndifferent arities.A naive compilation will compile f as below:let f = fun x -> fun y -> x + y\nfunction f(x){\n  return function (y){\n    return x + y;\n  }\n}\nfunction g(x){\n  var z = x + 1 ;\n  return function (y){\n    return x + z ; \n  }\n}\nIts arity will be consistent but is 1 (returning another function); however, \nwe expect its arity to be 2.Bucklescript uses a more complex compilation strategy, compiling f asfunction f(x,y){\n  return x + y ; \n}\nNo matter which strategy we use, existing typing rules cannot\nguarantee a function of type 'a -> 'b -> 'c will have arity 2.To solve this problem introduced by OCaml's curried calling convention, we \nsupport a special attribute [@bs] at the type level.external map : 'a array -> 'b array -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c [@bs]) -> 'c array\n= \"map\" [@@bs.val]\nHere ('a -> 'b -> 'c [@bs]) will always be of arity 2, in general \n'a0 -> 'a1 ... 'aN -> 'b0 [@bs] is the same as 'a0 -> 'a1 ... 'aN -> 'b0\nexcept the former's arity is guaranteed to be N while the latter is unknown.To produce a function of type 'a0 -> .. 'aN -> 'b0 [@bs], as follows:let f : 'a0 -> 'a1 -> .. 'b0 [@bs] = fun [@bs] a0 a1 .. aN -> b0 \nlet b : 'b0 = f a0 a1 a2 .. aN [@bs] \nA special case for arity of 0:let f : unit -> 'b0 [@bs] = fun [@bs] () -> b0 \nlet b : 'b0 = f () [@bs]\nNote that this extension to the OCaml language is sound. If you add \nan attribute in one place but miss it in other place, the type checker\nwill complain.Another more complex example:type 'a return = int -> 'a [@bs]\ntype 'a u0 = int -> string -> 'a return  [@bs]\n(* [u0] has arity of 2, return a function \n   with arity 1\n*)\ntype 'a u1 = int -> string -> int -> 'a [@bs]\n(* [u1] has arity of 3 *)\ntype 'a u2 = int -> string -> (int -> 'a [@bs]) [@bs]\n(* [u2] has arity of 2, reutrn a function \n   with arity 1\n*)\nUncurried calling convention as an optimizationBackgroundAs we discussed before, we can compile any OCaml function as arity 1 to \nsupport OCaml's curried calling convention.This model is simple and easy to implement, but\nthe native compilation is very slow and expensive for all functions.let f x y z = x + y + z\nlet a = f 1 2 3 \nlet b = f 1 2 \ncan be compiled asfunction f(x){\n  return function (y){\n    return function (z){\n      return x + y + z\n    }\n  }\n}\nvar a = f (1) (2) (3)\nvar b = f (1) (2)\nBut as you can see, this is highly inefficient, since the compiler already saw the source definition of f,\nit can be optimized as below:function f(x,y,z) {return x + y + z}\nvar a = f(1,2,3)\nvar b = function(z){return f(1,2,z)}\nBuckleScript does this optimization in the cross module level and tries to infer the arity as much as it can.Callback optimizationHowever, such optimization will not work with high-order functions, \ni.e, callbacks.For example,let app f x = f x\nSince f's arity is unknown, the compiler can not do any optimization (unless app gets inlined), so we \nhave to generate code as below:function app(f,x){\n  return Curry._1(f,x);\n}\nCurry._1 is a function to dynamically support the curried calling convention.Since we support the uncurried calling convention, you can write app\nas belowlet app f x = f x [@bs]\nNow the type system will infer app as type \n('a ->'b [@bs]) -> 'a and compile app asfunction app(f,x){\n  return f(x)\n}\nNote that in OCaml the compiler internally uncurries every function declared as external\nand guarantees that it is always fully applied.\nTherfore, for external first-order FFI, its outermost function does not need the [@bs] \nannotation.Bindings to callbacks which relies on thisMany JS libraries have callbacks which rely on this (the source), for example:x.onload = function(v){\n  console.log(this.response + v )\n}\nHere, this would be the same as x (actually depends on how onload is called). It is clear that\nit is not correct to declare x.onload of type unit -> unit [@bs]. Instead, we introduced a special attribute\nbs.this allowing us to type x as below:type x \nexternal onload : x -> (x -> int -> unit [@bs.this]) -> unit = \"onload\" [@@bs.set]\nexternal resp : x -> int = \"response\" [@@bs.get]\nonload x begin fun [@bs.this] o v -> \n  Js.log(resp o + v )\nend\nThe generated code would be as below:x.onload = function(v){\n  var o = this ; \n  console.log(o.response + v);\n}\nbs.obj is the same as bs: except that its first parameter is reserved for this and for arity of 0, there\nis no need for a redundant unit type:let f : 'obj -> unit [@bs.this] = fun [@bs.this] obj -> ....\nlet f1 : 'obj -> 'a0 -> 'b [@bs.this] = fun [@bs.this] obj a -> ...\nNote that there is no way to consume a function of type 'obj -> 'a0 .. -> 'aN -> 'b0 [@bs.this] on the OCaml side and\nwe don't encourage people to write code in this style. This was introduced mainly to be consumed by existing JS libraries.\nUser can also type x as a JS class too (see later)FFI to JS plain objectsJs object conventionAll JS objects of type 'a are lifted to type 'a Js.t to avoid\nconflict with OCaml's native object system (we support both OCaml's native object system and FFI to JS's objects).## is used in JS's object method dispatch and field access, \nwhile # is used in OCaml's object method dispatch.Create simple JS object literal and its typingBuckleScript introduces bs.obj extension, for example:let u = [%bs.obj { x = { y = { z = 3}}} ]\nWould be compiled asvar u = { x : { y : { z : 3 }}}}\nThe compiler would infer u as typeval u :  Js.t >  Js.t > Js.t\nTo make it more symmetric, we also apply the extension bs.obj \ninto the type level, so you can writeval u : [%bs.obj:  > > ]\nUsers can also write expressione and types together as below:let u = [%bs.obj ( { x = { y = { z = 3 }}} :  > > ]\nEven better, users can also write Objects in a collection:var xs = [%bs.obj [| { x = 3 } ; {x = 3 } |] :  array  ]\nvar ys = [%bs.obj [| { x = 3} : { x = 4 } |] ]\nwhich will be compiled as below:var xs = [ { x : 3 } , { x : 3 }]\nvar ys = [ { x : 3 },  {x : 4 } ]\nbs.obj can also be used as an attribute in external declarations, like as below:external make_config : hi:int -> lo:int -> unit -> t = \"\" [@@bs.obj]\nlet v = make_config ~hi:2 ~lo:3\nwill be compiled as  let v = { hi:2, lo:3}\nYou can use optional as wellexternal make_config : hi:int -> ?lo:int -> unit -> t = \"\" [@@bs.obj]\nlet u = make_config ~hi:3 ()\nlet v = make_config ~hi:3 ~lo:2 ()\nWill generatelet u = {hi : 3}\nlet v = {hi : 3 , lo: 2}\nField accessAs we said ## is used in both object method dispatch and field access.f##field (* field access should not come with any argument *)\nf##method args0 args1 args2 (* method with arities of 3 *)\nJS's method is not a function is a classic example shown below:console.log('fine')\nvar log = console.log;\nlog('fine') // May cause exception, implementation dependent, `console.log` may depend on `this` \nSo to make it clearly type safe, field accesses should not come with any argument.let fn = f##field in\nlet a = fn a b \n(* f##field a b would think `field` as a method *)\nNote that if a user were to make such a mistake, the type checker would complain by saying it expected Js.method but saw a\nfunction instead, so it is still sound and type safe.Currently bs.obj only supports plain JS object literals with no support fpr JS methods, class type (discussed later) supports JS style methods.Another example:let u = [%bs.obj {x = { y = { z = 3 }}; fn = fun [@bs] u v -> u + v } ]\nlet h = u##x##y##z\nlet a = h##fn\nlet b = a 1 2\nwill be compiled as below:var u = { x : { y : {z : 3}}, fn : function (u,v) {return u + v}}\nvar h = u.x.y.z\nvar a = h.fn\nvar b = a(1,2)\nWhen the field is an uncurried function, there is a short-hand syntax as below:let b x y h = h#@fn x y\nWill be compiled asfunction b (x,y,h){\n  return h.fn(x,y)\n}\nAnd the compiler will infer the type of b asval b : 'a -> 'b -> [%bs.obj:  'b -> 'c [@bs] ] -> 'c\nAs we said before, currently [%bs.obj] is only used for object literals with no this semantics.FFI to JS classesClass type declarationsBelow is an example:class type _rect = object\n  method height : int [@@bs.set]\n  method width : int [@@bs.set]\n  method draw : unit -> unit\nend [@bs]\ntype rect = _rect Js.t\nIn this example, class type annotated with [@bs] is treated as a JS class type.\nFor JS classes, methods with arrow types are treated as real methods while methods with non-arrow types\nare treated as properties. Since OCaml's object system does not have getters/setters, we introduced two\nattributes bs.get and bs.set to help inform BuckleScript to compile them as property getters/setters.Annotation to JS propertiesThere are various getter/setter decorations as below:class type _y = object \n  method height : int [@@bs.set {no_get}]\n  (* [height] is setter only *)\nend [@bs]\ntype y = _y Js.t \nclass type _y0 = object \n  method height : int [@@bs.set] [@@bs.get {null}] \n  (* getter reutrn [int Js.null]*)\nend [@bs]\ntype y0 = _y0 Js.t \nclass type _y1 = object \n  method height : int [@@bs.set] [@@bs.get {undefined}]\n  (* getter return [int Js.undefined]*)\nend [@bs]\ntype y1 = _y1 Js.t \nclass type _y2 = object \n  method height : int [@@bs.set] [@@bs.get {undefined; null}] \n  (* getter return [int Js.null_undefined] *)\nend [@bs]\ntype y2 = _y2 Js.t \nclass type _y3 = object \n  method height : int  [@@bs.get {undefined ; null}] \n  (* getter only, return [int Js.null_undefined] *)\nend [@bs]\ntype y3 = _y3 Js.t\nConsume JS class APIFor example,let f (u : rect) =   \n  (* the type annotation is un-necessary,\n     but it gives better error message\n  *) \n   Js.log u##height ; \n   Js.log u##width ;\n   u##width #= 30;\n   u##height #= 30;\n   u##draw ()\nWould be compiled as below:function f(u){\n  console.log(u.height);\n  console.log(u.width);\n  u.width = 30;\n  u.height = 30;\n  return u.draw()\n}\nNote the type system would guarantee that the user can not write such code:let v = u##draw \n(* use v later -- this is not allowed, type system will complain *)\nThis is more type safe than JavaScript's method is not function.Method chainingf\n##(meth0 ())\n##(meth1 a)\n##(meth2 a b)\nEmbedding raw Javascript codeNote that this is not encouraged. The user is should minimize and localize use cases \nof embedding raw Javascript code; however, sometimes it's necessary to get the job done.Embedding raw JS code as an expression\n\nlet keys : t -> string array [@bs] = [%bs.raw \"Object.keys\" ]\nlet unsafe_lt : 'a -> 'a -> Js.boolean [@bs] = [%bs.raw{|function(x,y){return x \nWe recommend writing type annotations for such unsafe code. It is unsafe to \nrefer to external OCaml symbols in raw JS code.Embedding raw JS code as statements\n\n[%%bs.raw{|\nconsole.log (\"hey\");\n|}]\nOther examples:let x  : string = [%bs.raw{|\"\\x01\\x02\"|}]\nIt will be compiled into:var x = \"\\x01\\x02\"\nPolyfill of Math.imul   [%%bs.raw{|\n   // Math.imul polyfill\n   if (!Math.imul){\n       Math.imul = function (..) {..}\n    }\n   |}]\nCaveats:So far we don't perform any sanity checks in the quoted text (syntax checking is a long-term goal).\n\nUsers should not refer to symbols in OCaml code. It is not guaranteed that the order is correct. \n\nDebugger supportWe introduced the extension bs.debugger, for example:  let f x y = \n    [%bs.debugger];\n    x + y\nwhich will be compiled into:  function f (x,y) {\n     debugger; // JavaScript developer tools will set an breakpoint and stop here\n     x + y;\n  }\nRegex supportWe introduced bs.re for Javascript regex expresion:let f  = [%bs.re \"/b/g\"]\nThe compiler will infer f has type Js_re.t and generate code as belowvar f = /b/g\nNote that Js_re.t is an abstract type, we are working on providing bindings for itExamples:Below is a simple example for mocha library. For more examples, please visit https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript-addonsA simple example: binding to mocha unit test libraryThis is an example showing how too provide bindings to the mochajs unit test framework.   external describe : string -> (unit -> unit [@bs]) -> unit = \"describe\" [@@bs.val]\n   external it : string -> (unit -> unit [@bs]) -> unit = \"it\" [@@bs.val \"it\"]\nSince, mochajs is a test framework, we also need some assertion\n   tests. We can also describe the bindings to assert.deepEqual from\n   nodejs assert library:   external eq : 'a -> 'a -> unit = \"deepEqual\"  [@@bs.call] [@@bs.val \"assert\"]\nOn top of this we can write normal OCaml functions, for example:   let assert_equal = eq\n   let from_suites name suite  = \n       describe name (fun [@bs] () -> \n         List.iter (fun (name, code) -> it name code) suite)\nThe compiler would generate code as below:   var Assert = require(\"assert\");\n   var List = require(\"bs-platform/lib/js/list\");\n\n   function assert_equal(prim, prim$1) {\n     return Assert.deepEqual(prim, prim$1);\n   }\n\n   function from_suites(name, suite) {\n      return describe(name, function () {\n              return List.iter(function (param) {\n                          return it(param[0], param[1]);\n                        }, suite);\n            });\n    }\n"},"Runtime-representation.html":{"url":"Runtime-representation.html","title":"Runtime representation","keywords":"","body":"Below is a description of how OCaml values are encoded in JavaScript, \nthe internal description means users should not rely on its actual\nencoding (and it is subject to change).

BuckleScript's motivation, like js_of_ocaml, is to unify the ubiquity of the JavaScript platform and the truly sophisticated type system of OCaml, however, there are some areas where we view things differently from js_of_ocaml. We describe below, some of these differences, and also refer readers to some of the original informal discussions.Js_of_ocaml takes lowlevel bytecode from OCaml compiler, BuckleScript takes the highlevel rawlambda representation from OCaml compiler\n\nJs_of_ocaml focuses more on existing OCaml eco-system(opam) while BuckleScript's major goal is to target npm\n\nJs_of_ocaml and BuckleScript have slightly different runtime encoding in several places, for example, BuckleScript encodes OCaml Array as JS Array while js_of_ocaml requires its index 0 to be of value 0.\n\nBoth projects are improving quickly, so this can change in the future!"}}}
